# CHAT-BOT

This project builds a text-based chatbot using Node.js, the OpenAI API, and readline-sync. The chatbot offers a dynamic conversational experience by:

- Understanding User Input: The readline-sync library facilitates capturing user questions through the command line.

- Context-Aware Responses: Previous questions and answers are stored in a conversation history, allowing the chatbot to generate responses that consider the ongoing conversation. This fosters a more natural and engaging interaction.

- OpenAI Integration: The OpenAI API empowers the chatbot to access and process information, crafting responses that are informative and relevant to the user's queries.
